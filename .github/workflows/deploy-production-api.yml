# Deploys apps to AWS Elastic Beanstalk. It takes the application name, environment name,
# version name, region and filename as parameters, uploads the file to S3, creates a 
# new version in Elastic Beanstalk, and then deploys that version to the environment

# TODO: DRY this up in a later refactor.
